    "long_synopsis": "Universities in Nigeria and Ghana have been plagued by stories of sexual harassment by lecturers and professors for decades. Allegations include a wide array of abuses, from blackmailing students for sex in exchange for marks and admission to lewd comments and grooming.\n \nAfter gathering dozens of testimonies, BBC Africa Eye sent undercover journalists posing as students inside the University of Lagos (UNILAG) and the University of Ghana to capture footage of the sexual harassment.  \n \nReporter Kiki Mordi, who knows first-hand how devastating sexual harassment can be, reveals what happens behind the closed doors of some of West Africaâ€™s most prestigious universities.\n\nHow have you been impacted by our investigation into sex for grades?
